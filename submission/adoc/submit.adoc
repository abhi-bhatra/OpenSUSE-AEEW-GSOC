// General comments
// Keep in mind that this is a "getting started" guide and the
//   audience that we are trying to reach.
// Leverage ASCIIDoc features to make this document readable and usable:
//   - Text highlights (follow SUSE style guides)
//   - Admonitions (i.e., NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING)
//   - Code blocks
//   - Lists (ordered and unordered, as appropriate)
//   - Links
//   - Images
//     - Place image files under the ./media directory tree
//       (e.g., ./media/src/svg, ./media/src/png)
//     - Format preferences: svg > png > jpg
//     - Consolidate images wherever possible;
//       that is, prefer text over images
//   - Sections and subsections to organize content and break up actions

== Introduction

image::gsoc_intro_banner.png[Google Summer of Code 2022]

This static webpage to submit the Google Summer of Code work for final evaluation. It is intended to point out to the Application documentation and walkthroughs for the Analytics Edge Ecosystem Workloads - Healthcare project. The project is a part of the Google Summer of Code 2022 program.

== Project Description

This Document will point out to the detailed approach undertaken to accomplish this project. The project is developed under mentorship of Bryan Gartner, Ann Davis, Brian Fromme and the SUSE organization.

This guide introduces the basic concepts and steps to install, configure, and use the Cancer Prediction System in a SUSE Rancher Kubernetes environment. It uses Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) to automatically recognize the complex patterns in imaging data, providing quantitative as well as qualitative assessments of data within a short period of time.
